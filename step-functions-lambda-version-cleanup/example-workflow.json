      "The workflow uses the `ListFunctions`, `ListVersionsByFunction` and `DeleteFunction` SDK calls to determine which functions should be processed as well as to get to know the available number of versions and to reduce them to a specified amount. The workflow takes Lambda aliases into account as well as provides the possibilty to filter which functions should be taken into account and how many versions - starting from the most recent one - should be kept available. An accompanying EventBridge scheduler can be used to trigger this workflow regularly in order to cleanup the Lambda versions completely automated."
