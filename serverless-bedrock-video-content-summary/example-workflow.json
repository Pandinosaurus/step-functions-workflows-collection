When a video is uploaded, an event in the AWS account triggers Amazon EventBridge, capturing the event. The system then proceeds to transcode the video for Amazon Transcribe or directly feeds it if it's already compatible. Both the transcoding and Amazon Bedrock workflow are orchestrated by the AWS Step Functions state machine. For additional information, please refer to the GitHub repository.",
